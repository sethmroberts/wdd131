      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        This site is a personal photo blog that blends visual storytelling with
        short reflections. It's meant to be a creative space where I can explore
        ideas, share meaningful moments, and practice combining photography with
        writing in a clean, focused format.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The intended audience includes friends, creatives, and anyone who enjoys
        photography, visual journaling, or reflective short-form content. It's
        also useful as a casual portfolio for future employers or collaborators
        who want to see my creative voice and style.
      </p>

      <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
      <p>
        The homepage dynamically generates photo blog post cards from an array of
        objects using JavaScript. Each post includes tags, and a “Filter by Tag”
        section lets users click a tag to filter posts. This uses DOM
        manipulation, event listeners, and array filtering logic.

        On the subpage, the page dynamically selects a random tag from the current
        post and displays four other photo cards that share that tag (if
        available). This highlights related content without requiring user input
        and demonstrates conditional logic, randomization, and filtered array
        rendering.

          I like photography because it feels like a puzzle — finding the shots
          that actually make me feel something. This site is just a quieter
          space to share some of those moments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most social media feels too loud, too fast. I wanted a corner of the
          internet that isn’t about chasing likes — just a place to put the
          things I’ve made. I believe in sharing what you create, even if it’s
          simple.

          <em>Preview Text:</em> Somewhere between towns I started noticing how
          good Idaho looks.<br />
          <em>Description:</em>
          I had pulled over on some backroad between towns, mostly because I
          couldn’t ignore how the light was landing on the fields. It wasn’t a
          planned stop—I just saw this patch of grass swaying and something in
          me said <em>wait</em>. The wind was doing its own choreography,
          brushing through the tall stems like it had somewhere to be, and I
          crouched down without even thinking. I remember how quiet it was out
          there. No traffic, no people—just the breeze, the sky, and this soft
          hum of evening light. I didn't have a tripod, so I braced my elbows on
          my knees and held my breath, hoping the shutter would catch what I was
          feeling.<br />

          <em>Preview Text:</em> We missed the best light, but this one ended up
          being my favorite.<br />
          <em>Description:</em>
          We got there later than we meant to. The sun had already dipped behind
          the mountains, and most of the light was gone—but somehow that made it
          better. The lake had turned into a sheet of colored glass, reflecting
          the last whispers of sunset in pink and blue. I stepped away from the
          others and stood alone near the reeds, the air colder than I expected.
          I only had a few minutes to take the shot before everything dimmed
          completely. It wasn’t dramatic or flashy—just still. The kind of still
          that feels like it’s saying something. I took a few frames, adjusted
          the focus by hand, and then just stood there a while longer, listening
          to nothing.<br />
