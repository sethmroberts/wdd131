      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        This site is a personal photo blog that blends visual storytelling with
        short reflections. It's meant to be a creative space where I can explore
        ideas, share meaningful moments, and practice combining photography with
        writing in a clean, focused format.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The intended audience includes friends, creatives, and anyone who enjoys
        photography, visual journaling, or reflective short-form content. It's
        also useful as a casual portfolio for future employers or collaborators
        who want to see my creative voice and style.
      </p>

      <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
      <p>
        The homepage dynamically generates photo blog post cards from an array of
        objects using JavaScript. Each post includes tags, and a “Filter by Tag”
        section lets users click a tag to filter posts. This uses DOM
        manipulation, event listeners, and array filtering logic.

        On the subpage, the page dynamically selects a random tag from the current
        post and displays four other photo cards that share that tag (if
        available). This highlights related content without requiring user input
        and demonstrates conditional logic, randomization, and filtered array
        rendering.

        <p>
          I like photography because it feels like a puzzle — finding the shots
          that actually make me feel something. This site is just a quieter
          space to share some of those moments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most social media feels too loud, too fast. I wanted a corner of the
          internet that isn't about chasing likes — just a place to put the
          things I've made. I believe in sharing what you create, even if it's
          simple.

          <strong>Wind in the Quiet</strong><br />
          <img src="images/sunset-field.jpeg" alt="sunset field" style="max-width: 300px" /><br />
          <em>Preview Text:</em> Somewhere between towns I started noticing how good Idaho looks.<br />
          <em>Description:</em>
          I had pulled over on some backroad between towns, mostly because I couldn't ignore how the light was landing on the fields. It wasn't a planned stop—I just saw this patch of grass swaying and something in me said <em>wait</em>. The wind was doing its own choreography, brushing through the tall stems like it had somewhere to be, and I crouched down without even thinking. I remember how quiet it was out there. No traffic, no people—just the breeze, the sky, and this soft hum of evening light. I didn't have a tripod, so I braced my elbows on my knees and held my breath, hoping the shutter would catch what I was feeling.<br />

          <strong>Stillness That Speaks</strong><br />
          <img src="images/sunset-lake.JPG" alt="sunset lake" style="max-width: 300px" /><br />
          <em>Preview Text:</em> We missed the best light, but this one ended up being my favorite.<br />
          <em>Description:</em>
          We got there later than we meant to. The sun had already dipped behind the mountains, and most of the light was gone—but somehow that made it better. The lake had turned into a sheet of colored glass, reflecting the last whispers of sunset in pink and blue. I stepped away from the others and stood alone near the reeds, the air colder than I expected. I only had a few minutes to take the shot before everything dimmed completely. It wasn't dramatic or flashy—just still. The kind of still that feels like it's saying something. I took a few frames, adjusted the focus by hand, and then just stood there a while longer, listening to nothing.<br />
          <em>Camera Info:</em> 50mm, f/2, 1/250 sec, ISO 100<br />

          <strong>Hitching a Ride</strong><br />
          <img src="images/ladybug.JPG" alt="ladybug on plant" style="max-width: 300px" /><br />
          <em>Preview Text:</em> Saw this little guy catching a ride on a breeze-blown leaf.<br />
          <em>Description:</em>
          I was focused on something else when I noticed this ladybug just hanging out, clinging to a leaf that wouldn't stop shaking in the wind. I had to wait for it to slow down just long enough to get a decent frame. The scale of it made me smile—this tiny speck in a huge world, doing its thing. Not posed. Not perfect. Just... alive.<br />

          <strong>Focused Work</strong><br />
          <img src="images/bee.JPG" alt="bee on flower" style="max-width: 300px" /><br />
          <em>Preview Text:</em> Bees don't care about the camera. They just work.<br />
          <em>Description:</em>
          It took way too many tries to get this shot. The bee kept weaving in and out of the flowers like it had somewhere to be (which it did, obviously). I finally caught it mid-dip. The wings were moving too fast to freeze completely, but I like that. Makes the image feel alive. A tiny slice of a busy day I almost missed.<br />

          <strong>All Facing the Same Way</strong><br />
          <img src="images/sunflower.JPG" alt="sunflower field" style="max-width: 300px" /><br />
          <em>Preview Text:</em> Sunflowers feel kind of like optimism in plant form.<br />
          <em>Description:</em>
          They were all lined up, facing the same direction, like they were watching something I couldn't see. I liked the symmetry—how something so wild could still feel orderly. The sky was hazy and soft, and the yellow popped more than I expected. It's one of those shots that didn't take much effort, just the right angle and a quiet pause.<br />

          <strong>Out of Frame</strong><br />
          <img src="images/airplane.JPG" alt="airplane over sunflowers" style="max-width: 300px" /><br />
          <em>Preview Text:</em> Looked up at the right second. Sometimes that's all it takes.<br />
          <em>Description:</em>
          I was lining up a wide shot of the field when I heard the plane. Looked up, saw it slicing through the sky above the sunflowers, and instinctively pulled the camera up. Got one frame that worked. It's not the best composition I've ever done, but something about the timing made it feel lucky. The contrast between something natural and something manufactured always gets me.<br />
