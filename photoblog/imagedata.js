    preview: "We missed the best light, but this one ended up being my favorite.",
    description: `We got there later than we meant to. The sun had already dipped behind the mountains, and most of the light was gone—but somehow that made it better. The lake had turned into a sheet of colored glass, reflecting the last whispers of sunset in pink and blue. I stepped away from the others and stood alone near the reeds, the air colder than I expected. I only had a few minutes to take the shot before everything dimmed completely. It wasn't dramatic or flashy—just still. The kind of still that feels like it's saying something. I took a few frames, adjusted the focus by hand, and then just stood there a while longer, listening to nothing.`,

    preview: "I almost missed her. Just a glint of red in all the green.",
    description: `It took forever to get the focus right—the ladybug kept moving, and the breeze wasn't helping. I ended up crouched in the grass holding my breath like it would steady my hand. Finally I caught her mid-climb. The color pop felt like a reward.`,

    preview: "It buzzed past my ear and I flinched—but then I saw the light hit just right.",
    description: `I've never loved bees, but there was something noble about how this one just kept working, even with a camera way too close. There was pollen dust everywhere. I caught it as the sun lit its wings and I barely adjusted the shutter in time.`,

    preview: "Sunflowers don't chase sunsets—they wait for morning.",
    description: `There's something kind of loyal about a flower that turns toward the sun every day. I got low for this shot to capture the height and that deep yellow that almost glows. The sky was quiet, which made it feel more intimate.`,

    description: `I was photographing the field when I heard the plane coming. I barely had time to adjust—just snapped and hoped. The contrast of the mechanical shape against the organic rows of flowers felt surreal. Right place, right time.`,

  preview: "Somewhere between towns I started noticing how good Idaho looks.",
  description: "I had pulled over on some backroad between towns, mostly because I couldn't ignore how the light was landing on the fields. It wasn't a planned stop—I just saw this patch of grass swaying and something in me said *wait*. The wind was doing its own choreography, brushing through the tall stems like it had somewhere to be, and I crouched down without even thinking. I remember how quiet it was out there. No traffic, no people—just the breeze, the sky, and this soft hum of evening light. I didn't have a tripod, so I braced my elbows on my knees and held my breath, hoping the shutter would catch what I was feeling.",

    description: "I was driving past a small dirt path when I caught a glimpse of something white and yellow in the grass. I reversed, pulled off, and found a quiet patch of wild daisies. There was nothing dramatic about the scene—just flowers doing what they do—but there was something kind about it. I laid in the grass for a minute, letting the wind push them around, and snapped a few shots from low to the ground. It reminded me how much beauty is waiting when you slow down enough to notice it.",
